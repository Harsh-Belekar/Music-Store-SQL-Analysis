# 🎵 Music Store SQL Analysis

This project analyzes a digital music store database using **PostgreSQL**.  
The database contains information about employees, customers, invoices, tracks, playlists, artists, albums, and more.  
Through SQL queries, we explore **sales trends, customer behavior, popular genres, top artists, and revenue insights**.
